                "comment": "This missense variant has not been reported in gnomAD (v2 and v3) [PM2]. It has been reported as a germline variant in an unaffected proband (30s) who had a suggestive family history, including thrombocytopenia and AML (SCV001375396.1); however, all other reports of the variant are not clearly germline (PMID: 19808697, 22689681, 24523240, 24659740, 25592059, 26273060, 27220669, 27534895, 28659335, 30373888, 31649132, 32045476, 32208489). The variant is located at a residue that directly contacts DNA (PMID: 11276260, 12377125, 12393679, 12807882, 19808697, 28231333) and is considered a hotspot residue (PMID: 31648317, 27294619, 23958918), especially from a somatic perspective (PMID: 32208489) [PM1]. The variant also demonstrates reduced DNA-binding and CBF\u03b2-binding (PMID: 17290219), as well as impaired erythropoeisis (PMID: 17234761, 21725049) [PS3_moderate], which is in line with computational evidence [PP3]. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel for RUNX1: PS3_moderate, PM1, PM2, and PP3.",
