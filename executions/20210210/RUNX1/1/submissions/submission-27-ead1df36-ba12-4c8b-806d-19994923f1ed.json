                "comment": "This synonymous variant is predicted by SSF and MES to lead to either an increase in the canonical splice site score or a decrease of the canonical splice site score by no more than 10% and no putative cryptic splice sites are created, and although evolutionary conservation prediction algorithms predict the site as being weakly conserved (PhyloP score: 1.66 > 0.1 [-14.1;6.4]), the variant is the reference nucleotide in one primate and/or three mammal species (BP4+BP7). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely benign. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel for RUNX1: BP4 and BP7.",
