                "comment": "This synonymous variant is present in gnomAD (v2 and v3) at an allele frequency >0.15% with at least 5 alleles in any general continental population (BA1); in addition, the variant was found in homozygosity in the population database (BP2). Although the variant is predicted by SSF and MES to create a putative cryptic donor splice site at c.925 (insignificant prediction by SpliceAI), evolutionary conservation prediction algorithms predict the site as being weakly conserved (PhyloP score: 1.25 > 0.1 [-14.1;6.4]), and the variant is not the reference nucleotide in one primate and/or three mammal species, SSF and MES predict either an increase in the canonical splice site score or a decrease of the canonical splice site score by no more than 10%. In summary, the clinical significance of this variant is benign. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel for RUNX1: BA1 and BP2.",
