                "comment": "This synonymous variant is present in gnomAD (v2 and v3) at an allele frequency >0.15% with at least >5 alleles in any general continental population (BA1); in addition, the variant was found in homozygosity in the population database (BP2). Although evolutionary conservation prediction algorithms predict the site as being moderately conserved (PhyloP score: 3.03 > 0.1 [-14.1;6.4]) and the variant is not the reference nucleotide in one primate and/or three mammal species, it is predicted by SSF and MES to lead to either an increase in the canonical splice site score or a decrease of the canonical splice site score by no more than 10% and no putative cryptic splice sites are created (BP4). In summary, the clinical significance of this variant is benign. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel for RUNX1: BA1, BP2, and BP4.",
