                "comment": "This synonymous variant is predicted by SSF, MES, and SpliceAI to lead to either no change/an increase/a decrease by no more than 10% in the canonical splice site score and no putative cryptic splice sites are created; in addition, evolutionary conservation prediction algorithms predict the site as not being highly conserved (PhyloP score = 0.223181 in GRCh37/0.744953 in GRCh38 or the variant is the reference nucleotide in one primate and/or three mammal species) (BP4+BP7). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely benign. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel for RUNX1: BP4 and BP7.",
