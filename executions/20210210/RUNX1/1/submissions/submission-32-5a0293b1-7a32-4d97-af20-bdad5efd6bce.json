                "comment": "The c.552G>T variant predicts a synonymous change, Pro184= and has an MAF of 0.001654 (0.17%, 33/19954 alleles) in the East Asian subpopulation of the gnomAD v2.1.1 cohort and is \u2265 0.0015 (0.15%) (BA1). This synonymous variant is predicted by SSF and MES to lead to either an increase in the canonical splice site score or a decrease of the canonical splice site score by no more than 10% and no putative cryptic splice sites are created (BP4). In addition, evolutionary conservation prediction algorithms predict the site as not being highly conserved (PhyloP score -8.975 < 0.1) (BP7). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as benign. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel for RUNX1: BA1, BP4, BP7.",
