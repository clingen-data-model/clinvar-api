                "comment": "This missense variant has not been reported in gnomAD (v2 and v3) [PM2]. It has been reported as a germline variant by SCV001203102.1 in a proband (70s) with thrombocytopenia and anemia; however, the germline origins were not confirmed in this case and all other reports of the variant (PMID: 19808697, 22689681, 24523240, 24659740, 25592059, 26273060, 27220669, 27534895, 28659335, 28933735, 30373888, 31649132, 32045476, 32208489, COSMIC). The variant is located at a residue that directly contacts DNA (PMID: 11276260, 12377125, 12393679, 12807882, 19808697, 28231333) and is considered a hotspot residue (PMID: 31648317, 27294619, 23958918), especially from a somatic perspective (PMID: 32208489) [PM1]. Although this variant has not been functionally evaluated, computational evidence supports a deleterious effect of this variant [PP3] and another missense variant at the same residue (i.e. p.R162G) is classified as likely pathogenic by the ClinGen MM-VCEP [PM5_supporting]. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel for RUNX1: PM1, PM2, PM5_supporting, and PP3.",
