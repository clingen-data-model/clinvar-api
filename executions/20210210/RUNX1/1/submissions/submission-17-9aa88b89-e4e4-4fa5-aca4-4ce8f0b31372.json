                "comment": "This late frameshift duplication is not expected to result in nonsense mediated mRNA decay, but will alter the transactivation domain/inhibitory domain/VWRPY motif and elongate the protein [PVS1_strong]. It is absent from gnomAD (v2 and v3) [PM2]. It has been described in a patient with thrombocytopenia (personal communication with last author) and short telomeres (<1st percentile), but the variant could not be confirmed in the germline (PMID: 29463756). However, other C-terminal frameshift variants have been reported with some showing loss of transactivation ability and a dominant-negative effect (PMID: 14615365, 19808697, 25840971). In summary, the clinical significance of this variant is likely pathogenic. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel for RUNX1: PVS1_strong and PM2.",
