                "comment": "This synonymous variant is predicted by SSF, MES, SpliceAI to lead to either no change/an increase/a decrease by no more than 10% in the canonical splice site score, and no putative cryptic splice sites are created (BP4). However, evolutionary conservation prediction algorithms predict the site as being conserved (PhyloP score = 3.39291 in GRCh37/3.78084 in GRCh38) and the variant is not the reference nucleotide in one primate and/or three mammal species. In summary, the clinical significance of this variant is uncertain. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel for RUNX1: BP4.",
