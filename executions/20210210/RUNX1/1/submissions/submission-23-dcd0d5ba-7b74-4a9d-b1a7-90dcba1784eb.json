In addition, this variant is completely absent from all population databases with at least 20x coverage for RUNX1 (PM2), and was identified in a a 65-year-old female tested due to \"thrombocytopenia with predisposition to AML\" (PS4_supporting; SCV000807767.1). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel for RUNX1: PVS1, PS4_supporting, and PM2.",
