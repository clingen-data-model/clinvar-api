A defect in BH4 metabolism was excluded through a BH4 loading test, urinary pterin analysis, and DHPR activity assay. This variant is absent from population databases gnomAD, 1000 Genomes and ESP. Splicing prediction algorithms predict this variant to be probably damaging. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic for PAH.
