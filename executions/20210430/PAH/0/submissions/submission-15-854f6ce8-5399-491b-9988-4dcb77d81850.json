This variant is absent from population databases gnomAD, 1000 Genomes and ESP. This variant in the -2 splice acceptor site of intron 6 disrupts the reading frame and is predicted to undergo nonsense mediated decay (NMD). The exon is present in biologically-relevant transcripts. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for PAH.
