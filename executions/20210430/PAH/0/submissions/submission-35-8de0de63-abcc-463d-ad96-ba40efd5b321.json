Loss of function in the PAH gene is a known mechanism of disease. Exon skipping is predicted to not disrupt the reading frame. This variant is predicted to alter a region that is critical to protein function. The PAH variant c.1065+1G>A (IVS10+1G>A) was identified in two French patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (mHP, 180 < Phe < 600 \u03bcmol/L) with the likely pathogenic variant c.261C>A (p.Ser87Arg) and with the pathogenic variant c.1169A>G (p.Glu390Gly)(PMID: 26666653). The PAH variant c.1065+1G>A was also reported in an European patient with PAH deficiency (PMID: 10679941). According to gnomAD, the PAH variant c.1065+1G>A (IVS10+1G>A) is present at a low allele frequency in population databases, with the highest reported frequency in the European (Finnish) population (0.00005). In summary, this variant meets the criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic.
