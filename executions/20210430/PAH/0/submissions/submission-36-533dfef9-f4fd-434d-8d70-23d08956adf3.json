(PMID: 15503242). This variant has a MAF (0.00016) in gnomAD. This variant creates a fully active, novel 5 \u0301 donor splice site which results in an aberrantly spliced mRNA with a 96-nt deletion at the 3 \u0301-end of exon 6 PMID: 8990021 (aka Ex6-96A>G). Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect. This variant was detected in trans with multiple pathogenic variants including: p.R111* (2); c.442-1G>A; p.R158W; p.L255S; p.P281L; p.K363Nfs*37; p.V399V; p.R408W; p.R241C (2); p.R243Q; p.R261Q (2); p.S349A; p.R413P; p.A434D (2) (PMID: 26322415). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for PAH.
