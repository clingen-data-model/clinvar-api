It was found with the pathogenic variant c.838G>A (p.Glu280Lys) (PM3_Supporting). The amino acid substitution is predicted damaging by multiple lines of computational evidence (PP3). It is absent from ethnically diverse control databases (PM2). Other missense variants at the site, including p.His290Arg, p.His290Tyr, and p.His290Gln are classified as Likely Pathogenic and Uncertain Significance. Thus, PM5 is not met. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as uncertain significance for PAH.
