This variant is present in European (non-Finnish) populations at an extremely low frequency in gnomAD (MAF=0.000008827). This variant in the -1 splice acceptor site of intron 7 disrupts the reading frame and is predicted to undergo nonsense mediated decay (NMD). The exon is present in biologically-relevant transcripts. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for PAH.
