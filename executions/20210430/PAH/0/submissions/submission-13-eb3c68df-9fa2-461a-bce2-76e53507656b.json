Computational evidence for this variant is conflicting; predicted to be damaging (SIFT), disease-causing (MutationTaster) and benign (PolyPhen2). This variant was found at an extremely low frequency in gnomAD (MAF=0.00005723). Functional studies have been reported with no major impact on enzyme activity as compared to wild type (PMID: 31208052). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as a variant of uncertain significance for PAH.
