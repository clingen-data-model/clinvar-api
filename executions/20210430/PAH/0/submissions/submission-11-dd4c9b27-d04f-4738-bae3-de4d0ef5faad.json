This is a frameshift variant in exon 6 out of 13 coding exons, predicted to undergo nonsense mediated decay (NMD). The exon is present in biologically-relevant transcripts. This variant is absent in population databases. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for PAH.
