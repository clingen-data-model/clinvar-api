At the time of review, the variant does not appear to be reported in the published literature and/or in the BioPKU database. The variant is predicted damaging by multiple lines of computational evidence (PP3). It is absent in gnomAD (PM2). Other missense variants at this site are pathogenic/likely pathogenic \u2013 p.Arg169Ser (variant ID 932262), p.Arg169His (variant ID 102706), p.Arg169Gly (variant ID 551103), and p.Arg169Cys (variant ID 125436) (PM5). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as uncertain significance for PAH.
