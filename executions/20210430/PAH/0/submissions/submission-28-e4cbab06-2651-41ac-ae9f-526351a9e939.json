This variant has been detected with pathogenic variants: p.I306V (PMID: 23430547) and c.664_665del (PMID: 17502162) (PM3). This variant has an extremely low frequency in gnomAD (MAF=0.000008792, PM2), and is predicted deleterious by SIFT, PolyPhen2, MutationTaster, and REVEL = 0.986 (PP3). This variant was shown to retain enzyme activity, but unfolds at a faster rate than WT (PMID: 18937047). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic for PAH.
