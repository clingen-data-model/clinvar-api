                "comment": "The c.820del (p.Gln274AsnfsTer37) variant is a frameshift variant that is not expected to result in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, but the predicted truncated/altered region (removes aa 310-480) is critical to protein function (PVS1_Strong). The variant is absent from gnomAD v2.1.1 and v3 with at least 20x coverage for RUNX1. It is not reported in the germ line in patients with FPD/AML in the literature, to the best of our knowledge. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel for RUNX1: PVS1_Strong, PM2.",
