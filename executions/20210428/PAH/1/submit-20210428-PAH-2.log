The variant has been previously reported as a single heterozygous variant in a proband with classic PKU (PMID: 20188615), with plasma Phe 1105 umol/L; BH4 deficiency does not appear to have been formally excluded (PP4). The authors speculated that the variant could \u201ceither affect the half life of the mRNA or its translation efficiency,\u201d but did not perform functional validation studies. The variant was absent in the mother, who was unaffected, and present as a single heterozygous variant in the father, who was also unaffected. The authors were unable to detect a second variant in the (affected) proband, which they argued could be due to it being \u201clocated in PAH intronic regions not covered in the screening strategy.\u201d It has also been found as a single heterozygous variant in a screening study of 3,552 healthy Japanese adults (PMID: 30887117). In ClinVar (ClinVar variant ID 657680), it is classified as VUS by one lab and Likely Benign by one lab, based on the above literature reports and uncertain functional consequences. Four heterozygotes and zero homozygotes are present for the variant in gnomAD; corresponding to a global AF of 0.000127 and maximum population frequency of 0.00128 (East Asian population), less than the 0.002 frequency threshold for use of BS1 and greater than the 0.0002 frequency threshold for use of PM2. The variant is predicted to not significantly alter splicing by multiple predictors (Splice AI score 0.00, MaxEntScan score variation 0.00%) (BP4). Classification: VUS Supporting Criteria: PP4; BP4",

It has also been observed with R408W (PMID: 28771436, parental testing not performed) (Pathogenic in ClinVar (ID 577) and by ClinGen PAH VCEP) and IVS4-1G>A (PMID: 29316886, parental testing unclear) (Pathogenic in ClinVar (ID 594) and by ClinGen PAH VCEP). Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis are conflicting. This is a novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different pathogenic missense change has been seen before (c.533A>G (p.Glu178Gly). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for PAH. PAH-specific ACMG/AMP criteria applied: PP4_Moderate, PM3_strong, PM2, PM5",

Loss of function in the PAH gene is a known mechanism of disease. Four null variants in exon 9 of the PAH gene have been reported. This variant is predicted to alter a region that is critical to protein function (13 pathogenic non-nonsense variants in the skipped exon have been reported). Exon skipping is not predicted to disrupt the reading frame. According to TraP in silico splicing prediction, this alteration is probably damaging (TraP score 0.968). HSF (-32.06% variation) and MaxEnt (-86.2% variation) agree that this alteration of the WT donor site most probably affects splicing. The PAH variant c.969+1G>A (IVS9+1G>A) was reported with the PAH pathogenic variant c.1222C>T (p.Arg408Trp) (ClinVar ID: 577) in a European patient with classical PKU (serum Phe levels above 1200\u03bcmol/L). Cofactor deficiency was excluded by the BH4 test (PMID: 10679941) and in a patient from Iran with classical PKU (serum Phe levels above 1200\u03bcmol/L) (PMID: 26413448). This variant is absent in the gnomAD, ExAC, and PAGE population databases. In summary, this variant meets the criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic.

This variant was reported in a Spanish patient with mild/moderate PKU. A defect in the synthesis or regeneration pathways of 6R-BH4 was ruled out by analyzing urinary pterin levels and measuring the dihydropteridine reductase activity (PMID: 27121329). This variant was detected in trans with pathogenic variant c.912+1G>A. It was found in extremely low frequency in gnomAD (MAF=0.00006). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic for PAH. PAH-specific ACMG/AMP criteria applied: PM2, PP4 moderate, PM3, and PP3.",

Computational evidence for this variant is conflicting; predicted to be damaging (SIFT), disease-causing (MutationTaster) and benign (PolyPhen2). This variant was found at an extremely low frequency in gnomAD (MAF=0.00005723).

This variant was found at an amino acid residue where p.Glu228Lys, a likely pathogenic missense variant, has been seen before. Computational evidence for this missense variant is conflicting; predicted to be tolerated (SIFT), disease-causing (MutationTaster) and benign (PolyPhen2). This variant is absent from population databases gnomAD, 1000 Genomes, and ESP. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as a variant of uncertain significance for PAH.

It is a novel missense change at an amino acid residue where different pathogenic missense changes have been reported (p.Met276Val is LP in ClinVar, p.Met276Lys is LP via PAH EP). It has been reported in individuals with phenylkeonuria in the literature, although a defect in the metabolism of BH4 has not been excluded as a cause for elevated phenylalanine in any of these patients (PMID: 23932990, 15300621).

In addition, the variant has been previously shown by RT-PCR analysis to alter RNA splicing (PS3_Supporting; PMID: 8535445). It is ultra-rare (highest observed population frequency 0.00001, with zero homozygotes, in gnomAD Non-Finnish European subpopulation), well under the PAH-specific frequency cutoff of 0.0002 (PM2).

Exon skipping is predicted to not disrupt the reading frame. This variant is predicted to alter a region that is critical to protein function. The PAH variant c.1065+1G>A (IVS10+1G>A) was identified in two French patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (mHP, 180 < Phe < 600 \u03bcmol/L) with the likely pathogenic variant c.261C>A (p.Ser87Arg) and with the pathogenic variant c.1169A>G (p.Glu390Gly)(PMID: 26666653). The PAH variant c.1065+1G>A was also reported in an European patient with PAH deficiency (PMID: 10679941). According to gnomAD, the PAH variant c.1065+1G>A (IVS10+1G>A) is present at a low allele frequency in population databases, with the highest reported frequency in the European (Finnish) population (0.00005).

This variant has a MAF (0.00016) in gnomAD. This variant creates a fully active, novel 5 \u0301 donor splice site which results in an aberrantly spliced mRNA with a 96-nt deletion at the 3 \u0301-end of exon 6 PMID: 8990021 (aka Ex6-96A>G). Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect. This variant was detected in trans with multiple pathogenic variants including: p.R111* (2); c.442-1G>A; p.R158W; p.L255S; p.P281L; p.K363Nfs*37; p.V399V; p.R408W; p.R241C (2); p.R243Q; p.R261Q (2); p.S349A; p.R413P; p.A434D (2) (PMID: 26322415).
