BH4 deficiency was excluded through a BH4 loading test, urinary pterin analysis, and DHPR activity assay for 1 patient. (PMID: 28754886, 28982351, 31445982). This is a nonsense variant in exon 11 out of 13 coding exons, predicted to undergo nonsense mediated mRNA decay. The exon is present in biologically-relevant transcripts. This variant is absent in population databases. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for PAH.
