In addition, the variant has been previously shown by RT-PCR analysis to alter RNA splicing (PS3_Supporting; PMID: 8535445). It is ultra-rare (highest observed population frequency 0.00001, with zero homozygotes, in gnomAD Non-Finnish European subpopulation), well under the PAH-specific frequency cutoff of 0.0002 (PM2). It has been found in multiple probands with classic PKU (e.g., PMID: 7726156, 8535445, 16256386, 17096675, 20187763, 22112818, 24350308, 23430918, 23764561, 8535445), although BH4 deficiency does not appear to have been formally excluded (PP4), including in trans with the Clinvar-Pathogenic R408W allele (PMID: 22112818) (PM3).", "dateLastEvaluated": "2018-12-22", "modeOfInheritance": "Autosomal recessive inheritance"}, "conditionSet": {"condition": [{"db": "MONDO", "id": "MONDO:0009861"}]}, "localID": "19dc340b-f7df-4865-bba3-db4b17bddcab", "localKey": "19dc340b-f7df-4865-bba3-db4b17bddcab", "observedIn": [{"collectionMethod": "curation", "alleleOrigin": "germline", "affectedStatus": "unknown", "numberOfIndividuals": 0}], "recordStatus": "novel", "releaseStatus": "public", "variantSet": {"variant": [{"gene": [{"symbol": "PAH"}], "hgvs": "NC_000012.12:g.102877461C>T"}]}}
