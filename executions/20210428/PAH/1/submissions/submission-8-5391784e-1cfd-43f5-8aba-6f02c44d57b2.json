This variant was detected in trans with pathogenic variants p.R243Q, p.R241Pfs*100; the validation tests on parents were performed using Sanger sequencing. Also found with pathogenic variant p.Y414C; parental testing not confirmed (PMID: 30050108, 31924462) (PM3-Strong). This variant is absent from controls in gnomAD, 1000 Genomes or ESP (PM2). Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect: SIFT, PolyPhen2, and MutationTaster. REVEL score =0.848 (PP4). Missesense variant p.Arg169Ser interpreted as pathogenic by ClinGen PAH VCEP, located at the same amino acid residue (PM5). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for PAH.
