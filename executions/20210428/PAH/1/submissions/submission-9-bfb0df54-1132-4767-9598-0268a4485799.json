This variant was reported in a Spanish patient with mild/moderate PKU. A defect in the synthesis or regeneration pathways of 6R-BH4 was ruled out by analyzing urinary pterin levels and measuring the dihydropteridine reductase activity (PMID: 27121329). This variant was detected in trans with pathogenic variant c.912+1G>A. It was found in extremely low frequency in gnomAD (MAF=0.00006). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic for PAH.
