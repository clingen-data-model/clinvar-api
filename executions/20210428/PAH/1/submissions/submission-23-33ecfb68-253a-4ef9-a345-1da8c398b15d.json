This variant was found at an amino acid residue where p.Glu228Lys, a likely pathogenic missense variant, has been seen before. Computational evidence for this missense variant is conflicting; predicted to be tolerated (SIFT), disease-causing (MutationTaster) and benign (PolyPhen2). This variant is absent from population databases gnomAD, 1000 Genomes, and ESP. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as a variant of uncertain significance for PAH.
