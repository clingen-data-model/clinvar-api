(PMID: 11935335). The -4173_-407del nomenclature was based on the translation initiation site, and corresponds to c.-4165_-407del3759 (based on transcription initiation site). This deletion is absent from gnomAD genomes with good coverage. This variant was detected with pathogenic variants: p.R408Q in 2 unrelated patients; p.E286K in 2 patients (pathogenic by PAH VCEP); and p.E76G in 1 patient (PMID: 24401910). Functional evidence suggests that it diminishes PAH gene expression (retained only 1% of the wild-type CAT activity, PMID: 11935335). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic for PAH.
