One heterozygote for the deletion is present in gnomAD, corresponding to an allele frequency of 0.000046 (structural variant version, gnomAD SVs v2.1), less than the 0.0002 cutoff for use of PM2 (PM2). It has been previously reported in one patient with PKU (BH4 deficiency excluded by sequencing of the genes in the BH4 cofactor metabolism pathway) (PP4_Moderate) (PMID: 23942198) in presumed trans with the p.G332R variant (unclassified/VUS).
