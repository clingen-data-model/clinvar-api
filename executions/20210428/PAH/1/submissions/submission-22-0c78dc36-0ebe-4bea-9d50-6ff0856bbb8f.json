Computational evidence for this missense variant is predicted to be damaging (SIFT), probably damaging (PolyPhen2), and disease causing (MutationTaster). This variant is absent from population databases gnomAD, 1000 Genomes, and ESP. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic for PAH.
