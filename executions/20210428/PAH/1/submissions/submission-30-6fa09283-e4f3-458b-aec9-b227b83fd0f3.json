It is absent from ethnically diverse control databases, including gnomAD (structural variant version, gnomAD SVs v2.1) (PM2). It has been previously reported in one patient with PKU (BH4 deficiency excluded by sequencing of the genes in the BH4 cofactor metabolism pathway) (PP4_Moderate) (PMID: 23942198) in presumed trans with the p.A313V variant (Pathogenic per PAH VCEP) (0.5 points; PM3_Supporting).
