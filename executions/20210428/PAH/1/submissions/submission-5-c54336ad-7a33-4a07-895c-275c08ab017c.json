(PP4_Moderate; PMID: 26503515; PMID: 26542770). This variant has an extremely low allele frequency (PopMax MAF=0.00006, ENF) in gnomAD (PM2). This variant was detected in trans with F39del (PMID: 26542770) (Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic in ClinVar by 7 submitters, see ID 188933). It has also been observed with R408W (PMID: 28771436, parental testing not performed) (Pathogenic in ClinVar (ID 577) and by ClinGen PAH VCEP) and IVS4-1G>A (PMID: 29316886, parental testing unclear) (Pathogenic in ClinVar (ID 594) and by ClinGen PAH VCEP). Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis are conflicting. This is a novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different pathogenic missense change has been seen before (c.533A>G (p.Glu178Gly). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for PAH.
