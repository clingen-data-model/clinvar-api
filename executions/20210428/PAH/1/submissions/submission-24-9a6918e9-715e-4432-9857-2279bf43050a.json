A defect in the synthesis or regeneration pathways of 6R-BH4 was ruled out. It was detected in trans with pathogenic variants Phe55Leufs*6 (PMID: 27121329) and c.442-1G>A (PMID: 29316886). This variant is absent in population databases. However, multiple lines of computation evidence suggest no impact on the PAH protein. In summary, computational evidence conflicts with case level evidence and is therefore classified as uncertain significance for PAH.
