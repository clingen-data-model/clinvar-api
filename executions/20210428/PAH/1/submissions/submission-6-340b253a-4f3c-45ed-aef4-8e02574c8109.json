Loss of function in the PAH gene is a known mechanism of disease. Four null variants in exon 9 of the PAH gene have been reported. This variant is predicted to alter a region that is critical to protein function (13 pathogenic non-nonsense variants in the skipped exon have been reported). Exon skipping is not predicted to disrupt the reading frame. According to TraP in silico splicing prediction, this alteration is probably damaging (TraP score 0.968). HSF (-32.06% variation) and MaxEnt (-86.2% variation) agree that this alteration of the WT donor site most probably affects splicing. The PAH variant c.969+1G>A (IVS9+1G>A) was reported with the PAH pathogenic variant c.1222C>T (p.Arg408Trp) (ClinVar ID: 577) in a European patient with classical PKU (serum Phe levels above 1200\u03bcmol/L). Cofactor deficiency was excluded by the BH4 test (PMID: 10679941) and in a patient from Iran with classical PKU (serum Phe levels above 1200\u03bcmol/L) (PMID: 26413448). This variant is absent in the gnomAD, ExAC, and PAGE population databases. In summary, this variant meets the criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic.
